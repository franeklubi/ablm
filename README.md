# ablm - The Online Metronome

**`NOTE`: This is a fork from [@franeklubi](https://github.com/franeklubi/ablm). I just added some features and fixed some bugs.**

The Ableton metronome's classic sound is the best, You can't prove me wrong.

But the hassle of starting up a VM with windows just to launch Ableton every time I want to play some piano almost makes me want to use other, clearly worse metronomes.

#### The obvious solution - make a web alternative

Introducing: ablm - The Online Metronome inspired by Ableton
